# Loss-or-Cost-functions
LOSS FUNCTION:
Loss function is a method of evaluating “how well your algorithm models your dataset”. If your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number. If they’re pretty good, it’ll output a lower number. As you tune your algorithm to try and improve your model, your loss function will tell you if you’re improving or not. ‘Loss’ helps us to understand how much the predicted value differ from actual value
